# Overview

Firstly, information on the internal working on the design and pattern can be [found here](../handler/01-overview.md) in the main handler documentation.

This package provides integration with `aws` and can be used with `lambda` to handle events from `apigw`, `sqs` or any other service that emits events.

```
npm i @phasma/handler-aws
```
